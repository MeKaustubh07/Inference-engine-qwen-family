    ids and raw logits go on (to the CPU, if the logits are elsewhere), where the penalty is recomputed exactly and
    each row finishes with the same code as `sample`. The server passes CPU logits: on the M2, torch.topk over a
    248k vocabulary is ~4x faster on the CPU than on MPS, and unified memory makes the copy cheap. Rows the candidates cannot represent exactly fall back to `sample`:
    top-k switched off (top-p over the whole vocabulary), top-k above BATCH_TOP_K_MAX, or ties at the k-th value
    that might extend past the candidates.

    A row that cannot be sampled (e.g. NaN logits) yields its exception in place of a token; the other rows are
    unaffected, and each row's generator is drawn from at most once (a seeded request's text never depends on
